# Actionables: Liberty, Progress, and Revolution

Liberty, Progress, and Revolution is a mod of the Actionables series for Victoria 3.

The mod adds 3 state variables, Independence, Innovation, and Uprising, that create events for countries around the globe, and 3 state variables, Liberty, Progress, and Revolution, that create events and cashouts in countries.

The goal of this mod is to add more actionable* event that are conditionned by the choices of other countries and to create a kind of "climate" during the different period of the game.

* Actionable means that provides direct, instant, and visible effects rather than chance-based, delayed, and implied. Gaining 1000 gold is an actionable event, gaining a level in a building is an actionable event, gaining Liberty, Progress, or Revolution points is an actionable event, gaining a 10% approval rating for the Intelligentsia interest group is not an actionable event.

## Balancing Design Principles

One of the major balancing design principles of LPR mods is that big powerful countries will be crippled by powerful communist and revolutionaries currents, while smaller countries get better ways to build and grow than in the base game. This creates a more dynamic and balanced global landscape where established powers face greater internal challenges, while emerging nations have enhanced opportunities for development and expansion.
