# Actionables: Liberty, Progress, and Revolution

Liberty, Progress, and Revolution is a mod of the Actionables series for Victoria 3.

The mod adds 3 state variables, Independence, Innovation, and Turmoil, that create events for countries around the globe, and 3 state variables, Liberty, Progress, and Revolution, that create events and cashouts in countries.

The goal of this mod is to add more actionable* event that are conditionned by the choices of other countries and to create a kind of "climate" during the different period of the game.

* Actionable means that provides direct, instant, and visible effects rather than chance-based, delayed, and implied. Gaining 1000 gold is an actionable event, gaining a level in a building is an actionable event, gaining Liberty, Progress, or Revolution points is an actionable event, gaining a 10% approval rating for the Intelligentsia interest group is not an actionable event.
