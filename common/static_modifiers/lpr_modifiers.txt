# LPR STATIC MODIFIERS
# ============================================================================
# These modifiers are applied temporarily (via events) to provide immediate
# gameplay effects when players choose certain paths in builder events.
#
# Note: Some modifiers (lpr_research_boost, lpr_tech_multiplier) are defined
# but may not be actively used in the current event system.
# ============================================================================

# Doubles technology research speed (currently unused in events)

# Halves technology research speed (currently unused in events)

# This significantly accelerates technology spread from other countries

# This helps spread social technologies faster

}

# Triples construction speed (used in Progress path builder events)
# This significantly accelerates all construction projects for 30 days

# Massive construction speed boost (used in big finisher events)

# These increase radicalism instead of adding radicals directly
