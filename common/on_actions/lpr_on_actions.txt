# ON ACTIONS - MONTHLY EVENT SYSTEM
# ============================================================================
# This file hooks into the monthly country pulse to trigger LPR events.
# 
# MONTHLY BUILDER EVENTS:
# - Builder events fire every month with 100% chance
# - This provides opportunities to accumulate LPR points every month
#
# THRESHOLD CHECKS:
# - Monthly check if any LPR variable has reached threshold for finisher events
# - Other events (binary, big finisher, threshold) check monthly with adjusted
#   probabilities
# ============================================================================
