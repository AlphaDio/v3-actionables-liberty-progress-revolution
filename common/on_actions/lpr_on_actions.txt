# ON ACTIONS - QUARTERLY/MONTHLY EVENT SYSTEM
# ============================================================================
# This file hooks into the monthly country pulse to trigger LPR events.
# Every quarter (January, April, July, October), each country:
# 1. Receives a builder event (45% chance) to accumulate LPR points
# 2. Checks if any LPR variable has reached threshold for finisher events
#
# Other events (binary, big finisher, threshold) check monthly with adjusted
# probabilities to extend their frequencies accordingly.
# ============================================================================
