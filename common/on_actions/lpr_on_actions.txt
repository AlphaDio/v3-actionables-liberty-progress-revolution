# ON ACTIONS - MONTHLY EVENT SYSTEM
# ============================================================================
# This file hooks into the monthly country pulse to trigger LPR events.
# Every month, each country:
# 1. Receives a builder event (100% chance) to accumulate LPR points
# 2. Checks if any LPR variable has reached 12 points (finisher threshold)
#
# The 100% chance is intentional for testing/guaranteed gameplay, but can
# be adjusted to a lower percentage for more random event timing.
