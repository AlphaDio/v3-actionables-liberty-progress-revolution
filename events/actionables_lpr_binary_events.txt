# ============================================================================
# BINARY CHOICE BUILDER EVENTS (Monthly Events)
# ============================================================================
# These events trigger when LPR variables reach 5 or more points.
# Each event offers a binary choice:
# - Commit to the path: Increase variable + small bonus
# - Reject the path: Decrease variable + big bonus
#
# These events create meaningful trade-offs for players who have already
# invested in a particular path, forcing them to decide whether to continue
# or cash out with a larger immediate reward.
