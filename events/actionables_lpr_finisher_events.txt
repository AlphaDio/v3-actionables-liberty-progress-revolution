# FINISHER EVENTS
# ============================================================================
# These events trigger when a country accumulates 12 points in any LPR category
# (Liberty, Progress, or Revolution). This typically happens after 4 monthly
# builder events where the player consistently chooses the same path.
# 
# The finisher events provide significant rewards but also reduce the accumulated
# points, creating a cycle of building up and cashing out.
